ISRAEL 
Affiliation: (also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries) 
 
Note: The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not 
included in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and 
reaffirmed by President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final 
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their 
neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated 
among the concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that these 
negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries.  Pending 
the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza 
Strip entries). On 25 April 1982, Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to 
Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in the 
Syria entry.

ECONOMY 
Overview: Israel has a market economy with substantial government 
participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and 
military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively 
developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. 
Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services 
most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural 
products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts 
balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments 
from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17 billion 
external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major source of 
scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, 
which topped 400,000 during the period 1990-92, has increased unemployment, 
intensified housing problems, and widened the government budget deficit. At 
the same time, a considerable number of the immigrants bring to the economy 
valuable scientific and professional expertise.
