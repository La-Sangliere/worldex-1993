ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and 
crops.  Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the 
population, but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving force 
behind the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining 
industry. This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from 
generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other sector has experienced 
such growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall 
and poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although 
diamond production was down slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output 
and manufacturing helped boost the economy
