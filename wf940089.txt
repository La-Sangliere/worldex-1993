ECONOMY 
Overview: With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, 
prospects seemed bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into 
the highly successful West German economy. The Federal Republic, however, 
continues to experience difficulties in integrating and modernizing eastern 
as the Bundesbank set high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects 
of large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany grew 
by 6.8% in 1992 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite government 
transfers to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion annually, a 
self-sustaining economy in the region is still some years away. The bright 
spots are eastern Germany's construction, transportation, telecommunications, 
and service sectors, which have experienced strong growth. Western Germany has 
an advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly 
urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, 
abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western 
Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important 
mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically 
advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: services and manufacturing 
account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and 
semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent years, 
manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors 
contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1992 accounted for 
about 21.5% of GDP.  GDP in the western region is now $20,000 per capita, or 
85% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears to be changing 
from one anchored on manufacturing into a more service-oriented economy. The 
German government, however, is intent on maintaining a manufacturing base in 
the east and is considering a policy for subsidizing industrial cores in the 
region. Eastern Germany's share of all-German GDP is only 7% and eastern 
productivity is just 30% that of the west even though eastern wages are at 
roughly 70% of western levels. The privatization agency for eastern Germany, 
Treuhand, has privatized more than four-fifths of the almost 12,000 firms 
under its control and will likely wind down operations in 1994. Private 
investment in the region continues to be lackluster, resulting primarily from 
the deepening recession in western Germany and excessively high eastern wages. 
Eastern Germany has one of the world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite 
coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of 
statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain; the 
federal government began producing all-German data for select economic 
statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is 
promoting eastern Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding 
the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will spur 
investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western Germany's 
economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The government 
hopes a "solidarity pact" among labor unions, business, state governments, and 
the SPD opposition will provide the right mix of wage restraints, investment 
incentives, and spending cuts to stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the 
homogeneity of the German economic culture has been changed by the admission 
of large numbers of immigrants.
