GAZA STRIP 
Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with 
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a 
peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the 
concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will 
resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process, it 
is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet 
to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all of the area 
west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework 
agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be made between 
Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status 
and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of 
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West 
Bank.

ECONOMY 
Overview: In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across 
the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, 
with worker remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The 
construction, agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, 
and 8% of GNP, respectively.  Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its 
external trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-93 (intifadah) has raised 
unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans.  The 
Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza 
since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged, 
unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically.  The area's 
economic outlook remains bleak.
