ECONOMY 
Overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and 
exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the 
economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee 
and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to 
diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related 
industries. The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and 
about 80% of export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A 
collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a 
recession, from which the country had not recovered by 1990.  Continuing low 
prices for commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated 
public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery 
in 1991. The government, which has sponsored various economic reform programs, 
especially in agriculture, projected an increase of 1.6% in GNP in 1992.
