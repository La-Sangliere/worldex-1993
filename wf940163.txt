ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the 
resolution of a trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound 
in textile sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in 
worker remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling 
agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped 
domestic demand, import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely 
affected by phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached 
a new 12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the IMF. In February 
1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's commercial debt. 
This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan 
authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations 
without additional rescheduling.  Servicing this large debt, high unemployment, 
and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain severe 
long-term problems. In 1992 Morocco embarked on a program to privatize 112 
state-owned companies. A severe winter drought in 1991/92 cut back 
agricultural output in 1992.
