ECONOMY 
Overview: Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of 
the late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged more than 
10%.  In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and 
worker remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per 
year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have 
been outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, 
and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling 
negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually 
reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The 
Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's 
already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF 
program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid 
from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have 
flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is 
unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.
