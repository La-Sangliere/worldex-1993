ECONOMY 
Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of 
several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly 
increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of 
the labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high 
unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical 
assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the 
leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the 
labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not 
self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for 
90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an 
annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in 1988. 
Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for about 25% 
of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 
1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and 
balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for FY92 show a 
moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism, and 
government investment outlays.
