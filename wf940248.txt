exclusive economic zone: 200 nm claimed by most but can vary 
 
territorial sea: 12 nm claimed by most but can vary 
 
note: boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many countries

Natural resources: the rapid using up of nonrenewable mineral resources, 
the depletion of forest areas and wetlands, the extinction of animal and plant

Europe and the former USSR) pose serious long-term problems that governments 
and peoples are only beginning to address

ECONOMY 
Overview: Real global output--gross world product (GWP)--rose one-half of 
1% in 1992, with results varying widely among regions and countries. Average 
growth of 1.5% in the GDP of industrialized countries (62% of GWP in 1992) and 
average growth of 5% in the GDP of less developed countries (30% of GWP) were 
offset by a further 15-20% drop in the GDP of the former Soviet-East European 
area (now only 8% of GWP). The United States accounted for 23% of GWP in 1992; 
the 12-member European Community, which established a single internal market 
on 1 January 1993, accounted for another 23%, and Japan accounted for 10%. 
These are the three "economic superpowers" presumably destined to compete for 
mastery in international markets on into the 21st century. In general, growth 
in the industrialized countries was sluggish in 1992, with unemployment 
typically at 7-11%. As for the less developed countries, China, India, and the 
Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore--posted good 
records; however, many other countries, especially in Africa, suffered 
bitterly from drought, rapid population growth, and civil strife. The 
continued plunge in production in practically all the former Warsaw Pact 
economies strained the political and social fabric of these newly independent 
nations, in particular in Russia. The addition of nearly 100 million people 
their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate 
resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at 
least from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. (For 
the specific economic problems of each country, see the individual country 
entries in this volume.) 
 
National product: GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power equivalent 
- $25.6 trillion (1992 est.) 
 
National product real growth rate: 0.5% (1992 est.) 
 
National product per capita: $4,600 (1992 est.) 
 
developed countries: 5% (1992 est.) 
 
developing countries: 50% (1992 est.) 
 
note: these figures vary widely in individual cases 
 
Unemployment rate: developed countries typically 7-11%; developing 
countries, extensive unemployment and underemployment (1992) 
 
Exports: $3.64 trillion (f.o.b., 1992 est.) 
 
commodities: the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and 
services 
 
partners: in value, about 75% of exports from the developed countries 
 
Imports: $3.82 trillion (c.i.f., 1992 est.) 
 
commodities: the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and 
services 
 
partners: in value, about 75% of imports by the developed countries 
 
External debt: $1 trillion for less developed countries (1992 est.) 
 
Industrial production: growth rate -1% (1992 est.) 
 
Electricity: 2,864,000,000 kW capacity; 11,450,000 million kWh produced, 
2,150 kWh per capita (1990) 
 
Industries: industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, 
especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and 
medical equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a 
small portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to 
these technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial 
nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid 
development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating 
already grim environmental problems 
 
Agriculture: the production of major food crops has increased 
substantially in the last 20 years; the annual production of cereals, for 
instance, has risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 
billion metric tons; production increases have resulted mainly from increased 
yields rather than increases in planted areas; while global production is 
sufficient for aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population 
for food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in 
recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation 
 
Economic aid: NA 
 
COMMUNICATIONS 
Railroads: 239,430 km of narrow gauge track; 710,754 km of standard gauge 
track; 251,153 km of broad gauge track; includes about 190,000 to 195,000 km 
of electrified routes of which 147,760 km are in Europe, 24,509 km in the Far 
East, 11,050 km in Africa, 4,223 km in South America, and only 4,160 km in 
North America; fastest speed in daily service is 300 km/hr attained by 
France's SNCF TGV-Atlantique line 
 
Ports: Mina al Ahmadi (Kuwait), Chiba, Houston, Kawasaki, Kobe, Marseille, 
New Orleans, New York, Rotterdam, Yokohama 
 
Merchant marine: 23,943 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 397,225,000 
GRT/652,025,000 DWT; includes 347 passenger-cargo, 12,581 freighters, 5,473 
bulk carriers, and 5,542 tankers (January 1992)
