ECONOMY 
Overview: The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget 
revenues, 35% of GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the 
largest reserves of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of 
petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the government 
intends to encourage private economic activity and to foster the gradual 
process of turning Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial state that retains 
traditional Islamic values. Four million foreign workers play an important 
role in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors.
