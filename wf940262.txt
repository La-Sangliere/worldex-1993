ECONOMY
Overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by
fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because the number of
ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March
1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint
Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three
years.  The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought
fish exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France.  Imports
come primarily from Canada and France.
