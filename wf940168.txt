ECONOMY 
Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the 
world.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for 
over 90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity 
is limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, 
sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has 
expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in FY91. 
by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of 2.6%. More than 40% 
of the population is undernourished partly because of poor distribution. The 
top 10% of the population receives 47% of total income, the bottom 20% less 
than 5% of the total. Since May 1991, the government has been encouraging 
trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses and 
registration requirements in order to simplify domestic and foreign 
investment. The government also has been cutting public expenditures by 
reducing subsides, privatizing state industries, and laying off civil 
servants. Prospects for foreign trade and investment in the 1990s remain poor, 
however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological 
backwardness, and its remoteness.
