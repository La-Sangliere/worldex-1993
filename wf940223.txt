ECONOMY 
Overview: Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest 
in May 1992 to post an impressive 7% growth rate for the year. Thailand, one 
of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, depends on exports of 
manufactures and the development of the service sector to fuel the country's 
rapid growth. The trade and current account deficits fell in 1992; much of 
Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment suggesting that the 
export sector is poised for further growth. With foreign investment slowing, 
years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the return 
of a democratically elected government has improved business confidence. 
Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to 
complete much needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand is to 
remain an attractive place for business investment. Over the longer-term, 
Bangkok must produce more college graduates with technical training and 
upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid economic development.
