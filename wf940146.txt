ECONOMY 
Overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed 
countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the 
population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% 
of export revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth 
improved significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly 
based economic adjustment effort by the government. Drought cut overall output 
sharply in 1992. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic 
assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations.
