ECONOMY 
Overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to 
exploit the economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and 
transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and investment 
declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders, 
lack of government administrative control, and a growing foreign debt. A sharp 
increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic reform policy, resulted in 
successive years of economic growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined 
steadily since 1989. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75% 
of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 
20-40% of capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep 
afloat. The continuation of civil strife has dimmed chances of foreign 
investment, and growth was a mere 0.3% in 1992. Living standards, already 
abysmally low, fell further in 1991-92.
