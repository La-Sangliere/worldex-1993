ECONOMY 
Overview: Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy has begun to 
emerge from a lengthy depression in the last few years. The economy fell 
sharply through most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil 
prices. This sector accounts for 80% of export earnings and almost 20% of GDP. 
The government, in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of 
austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. 
The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990 and 1991, however, helped along 
by rising oil prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force 
and produces about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable 
to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks 
to diversify its export base.
