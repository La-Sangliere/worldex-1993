ECONOMY 
Overview: Since Castro's takeover of Cuba in 1959, the economy has been 
run in the Soviet style of government ownership of substantially all the means 
of production and government planning of all but the smallest details of 
economic activity. Thus, Cuba, like the former Warsaw Pact nations, has 
remained in the backwater of economic modernization. The economy contracted by 
about one-third between 1989 and 1992 as it absorbed the loss of $4 billion of 
annual economic aid from the former Soviet Union and much smaller amounts from 
Eastern Europe. The government implemented numerous energy conservation 
measures and import substitution schemes to cope with a large decline in 
imports. To reduce fuel consumption, Havana has cut back bus service and 
imported approximately 1 million bicycles from China, domesticated nearly 
200,000 oxen to replace tractors, and halted a large amount of industrial 
production. The government has prioritized domestic food production and 
promoted herbal medicines since 1990 to compensate for lower imports. Havana 
also has been shifting its trade away from the former Soviet republics and 
Eastern Europe toward the industrialized countries of Latin America and the 
OECD.
