ECONOMY 
Overview: Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Soviet-style 
economy - with state ownership and control of productive assets - to a market 
economy. On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarity-led government implemented 
shock therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the 
money supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, 
and restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and 
lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 44% in 1992. 
Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external 
debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994. The 
private sector accounted for 29% of industrial production and nearly half of 
nonagricultural output in 1992. Production fell in state enterprises, however, 
and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing in 1989 to 
13.6% in December 1992. Poland fell out of compliance with its IMF program by 
mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The increase in 
unemployment and the decline in living standards led to strikes in the coal, 
auto, copper, and railway sectors in 1992. Large state enterprises in the 
coal, steel, and defense sectors plan to halve employment over the next 
decade, and the government expects unemployment to reach 3 million (16%) in 
1993. A shortfall in tax revenues caused the budget deficit to reach 6% of GDP 
in 1992, but industrial production began a slow, uneven upturn. In 1993, the 
government will struggle to win legislative approval for faster privatization 
and to keep the budget deficit within IMF-approved limits.
