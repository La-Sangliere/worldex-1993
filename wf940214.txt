ECONOMY 
Overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, 
adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and 
counterproductive economic policies. The economy is dominated by governmental 
entities that account for more than 70% of new investment. The private 
sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most private 
industrial investment predating 1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which 
employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. 
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable largely to 
declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and 
consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause 
difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of 
declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the 
Fund. Despite subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the 
IMF and the World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs 
lack the incentive to take economic risks. Growth in 1992 was featured by the 
recovery of agricultural production in northern Sudan after two years of 
drought.
