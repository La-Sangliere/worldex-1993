ECONOMY 
Overview: The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy, 
hydrocarbons accounting for nearly all export receipts, about 30% of 
government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in 
oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious program 
of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the 
mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the nation 
to its most serious social and economic crisis since full independence in 
1988. The current government has put reform, including privatization of some 
public sector companies and an overhaul of the banking and financial system, 
on hold, but has continued efforts to admit private enterprise to the 
hydrocarbon industry.
