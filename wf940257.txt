ECONOMY
Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand.
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up
by grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public
employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening,
although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of
small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream.
The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population
because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.
