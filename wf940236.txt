ECONOMY 
Overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically 
advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $23,400, the largest 
among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most 
decisions made by private individuals and business firms and with government 
purchases of goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 
the economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the 
longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and 
consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the 
labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of 
factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline in 
business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell by 1%, unemployment 
grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.  Growth picked up to 2.1% in 
1992. Unemployment, however, remained at nine million, the increase in GDP 
being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker. Ongoing problems for 
the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly 
rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade deficits.
