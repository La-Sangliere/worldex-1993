ECONOMY 
Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private 
enterprise.  The government makes its presence felt, however, through many 
regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects 
of economic activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 
50% of GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the 
food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly 
mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but 
provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing industry. 
Unemployment and a sizable budget deficit are currently the most serious 
economic problems. Many of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the 
course of European economic integration.
