began after the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this separation was 
further solidified following the Turkish invasion of the island in July 1974, 
which gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots 
control the only internationally recognized government; on 15 November 1983 
Turkish Cypriot President Rauf DENKTASH declared independence and the 
formation of a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), which has been 
recognized only by Turkey; both sides publicly call for the resolution of 
intercommunal differences and creation of a new federal system of government

Flag: white with a copper-colored silhouette of the island (the name

olive branches in the center of the flag; the branches symbolize the hope for 
peace and reconciliation between the Greek and Turkish communities

Overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. 
Industry contributes 16.5% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while 
the service sector contributes 62% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force. 
Rapid growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in 
tourism have played important roles in the average 6.8% rise in GDP between 
1986 and 1990. This progress was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the 
adverse effects of the Gulf War on tourism. Nevertheless in mid-1991, the 
World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of developing countries. In 
contrast to the bright picture in the south, the Turkish Cypriot economy has 
less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a series of reverses in 1991. 
Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the collapse of the 
fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a drought, the 
Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant from Turkey to 
help ease the burden of the economic crisis. In addition, the Turkish 
government extended a $100 million loan in November 1992 to be used for 
economic development projects in 1993. Turkey normally underwrites a 
substantial portion of the Turkish Cypriot economy.
