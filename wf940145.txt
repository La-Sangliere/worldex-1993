ECONOMY 
Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. 
Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, 
accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing to more than 70% of total 
export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of 
agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 
13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan 
that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased 
production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After mid-1991, however, 
output dropped sharply because of protracted antigovernment strikes and 
demonstrations for political reform.
