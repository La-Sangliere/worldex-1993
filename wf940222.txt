ECONOMY 
Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The 
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of 
GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry 
accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural 
products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in 
mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and 
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the 
International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to 
rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 
1991-92 featured a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase 
in output of minerals led by gold.
