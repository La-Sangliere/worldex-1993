ECONOMY 
Overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By 
treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights 
to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, 
Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies 
still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are 
essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs 
nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local 
services, and provides most of the local infrastructure.  There is also some 
trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.
