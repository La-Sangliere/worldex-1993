ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies 
most of the labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, 
which includes a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another 
quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade 
iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand 
for asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of 
hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with 
Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it 
receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
