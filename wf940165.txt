Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to

among the richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for 
gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, 
tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half the population depends on 
agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.
