ECONOMY 
Overview: Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy has benefited from the 
oil production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 
1991 provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars from Arab, 
European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's 
war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears, restore 
suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian purchases. 
In 1992 the government spurred economic development by loosening controls on 
domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict political controls. 
For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large number of 
poorly performing public sector firms and industrial and agricultural 
productivity is poor. A major long-term concern is the additional drain of 
upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects 
are completed by mid-decade.
