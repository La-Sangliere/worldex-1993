ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the 
most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of 
GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force. Since 1987, 
real GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually. Over the same 
period, inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have been 
transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment, at 22.7% remains a serious 
problem, however, and job creation is the main focus of government policy.  To 
ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts foreign investors and recently 
created a new industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms. 
Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit reduction 
measures. After five years of fiscal restraint, total government debt still 
exceeds GDP. Growth probably will moderate in 1993 as the heavily indebted and 
trade-dependent economy is highly sensitive to changes in exchange rates and 
world interest rates.  Exports to the UK, Ireland's major export market, 
probably will be hurt by the recent appreciation of the Irish currency against 
sterling - for the first time since 1979 the value of the Irish pound exceeds 
that of its British counterpart.
