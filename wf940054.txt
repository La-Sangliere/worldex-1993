ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic development has slowed gradually since 1986, but growth 
rates remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative economic policies 
have kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid 
development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries in recent years 
has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's major export. 
The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer of 1989, a 
troublesome rural insurgency, energy rationing, and drug-related violence have 
resurgence expected from government reforms.  These reforms center on fiscal 
restraint, trade and investment liberalization, financial and labor reform, 
and privatization of state utilities and commercial banks.
