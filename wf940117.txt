ECONOMY 
Overview: Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on 
agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same 
total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided 
into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and an 
undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises. 
Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public 
administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of 
energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual average rate 
of 3% in 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992. In the second 
half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to 
participate in EC plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade; 
thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances.  Thanks to the 
determination of Prime Minister AMATO, the government adopted a fairly 
stringent budget for 1993, abandoned its highly inflationary wage indexation 
system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social welfare 
programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary officials, who 
were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary system in 
September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in currency markets, remain 
committed to bringing the currency back into the grid as soon as conditions 
warrant. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering 
communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and 
adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic 
integration of the European Community.
