ECONOMY 
Overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proven crude 
oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world reserves. Kuwait is 
rebuilding its war-ravaged petroleum sector and the increase in crude oil 
production to nearly 2.0 million barrels per day by the end of 1992 led to an 
enormous increase in GDP for the year. The government ran a cumulative fiscal 
deficit of approximately $70 billion over its last two fiscal years, reducing 
its foreign asset position and increasing its public debt to roughly $40 
billion. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and over 90% of export and 
government revenue.
