ECONOMY
Overview: Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining
the EC in 1986 - at least 4% each year through 1990 - it remains one of the
poorest members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
privatization program. As of 1 January 1993, Lisbon has fully liberalized its
capital markets and most trade markets. The global slowdown and tight monetary
policies to counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991 and 1992. Growth
probably will remain depressed in 1993, but should pick up again in 1994.
