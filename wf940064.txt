Overview: The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent nation 
states - the Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated 
the task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old 
Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European standards, 
suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in 
energy and many raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after 
the end of communist control of Eastern Europe, theCzech and Slovak Federal 
Republic launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely 
state-owned and controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these 
measures resulted in privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic 
activity and the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a 
cost in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a 
whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992, in the 
Czech lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP was down a more 
moderate 5%. For 1993 the government of the Czech Republic anticipates 
inflation of 15-20% and a rise in unemployment to perhaps 12% as some 
large-scale enterprises go into bankruptcy; GDP may drop as much as 3%, mainly 
because of the disruption of trade links with Slovakia. Although the 
governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia had envisaged retaining the 
koruna as a common currency, at least in the short term, the two countries 
ended the currency union in February 1993.
