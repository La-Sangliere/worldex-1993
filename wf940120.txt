ECONOMY 
Overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a 
comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with 
extraordinary rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most 
important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw 
materials and fuels. Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of 
its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the 
world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global 
catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 
1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic growth slowed markedly in 
1992 largely because of contractionary domestic policies intended to wring 
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. At the same time, 
the stronger yen and slower global growth are containing export growth. 
Unemployment and inflation remain low at 2%. Japan continues to run a huge 
trade surplus - $107 billion in 1992, up nearly 40% from the year earlier - 
which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The crowding of its 
habitable land area and the aging of its population are two major long-run 
problems.
