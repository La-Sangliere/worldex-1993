Overview: Kyrgyzstan's small economy (less than 1% of the total for the 
former Soviet Union) is oriented toward agriculture, producing mainly 
livestock such as goats and sheep, as well as cotton, grain, and tobacco. 
Industry, concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric 
motors, livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, 
paper, and bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals 
being coal, rare earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of many 
types of food and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. In 1992, the 
Kirghiz leadership made progress on reform, primarily by privatizing business, 
granting life-long tenure to farmers, and freeing most prices.  Nonetheless, in 
1992 overall industrial and livestock output declined because of acute fuel 
shortages and a widespread lack of spare parts.
