ECONOMY 
Overview: Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and 
tea make up 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, 
however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The 
industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. 
Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The 
Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak 
international prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per 
capita GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank 
began in October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October 1990, has 
dampened prospects for economic improvement.
