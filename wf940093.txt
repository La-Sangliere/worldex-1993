ECONOMY 
Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic 
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged 
the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister 
MITSOTAKIS took office. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign 
exchange, and agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, 
and animal feedstuffs. Since 1986, real GDP growth has averaged only 1.6% a 
year, compared with the Europen Community average of 3%. The MITSOTAKIS 
government has made little progress during its two and one-half years in power 
in coming to grips with Greece's main economic problems: an inflation rate 
still four times the EC average, a large public sector deficit, and a fragile 
current account position. In early 1991, the government secured a three-year, 
$2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet 
imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with 
Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. On the advice of the 
EC Commission, Greece delayed applying for the second installment until 1993 
because of the failure of the government to meet the 1992 targets. Although 
MITSOTAKIS faced down the unions in mid-1992 in a dispute over privatization 
plans, social security reform, and tax and price increases, and his new 
economics czar, Stephanos MANOS, is a respected economist committed to 
renovating the ailing economy. However, a national elections due by May 1994 
will probably prompt MITSOTAKIS to backtrack on economic reform. In 1993, the 
GDP growth rate likely will remain low; the inflation rate probably will 
continue to fall, while remaining the highest in the EC.
