ECONOMY 
Overview: Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, 
employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. 
Paraguay lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but does have a 
large hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined 
compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average 
annual rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of 
five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose. 
Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the 
completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak 
international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy 
experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and 
stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery 
continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a major 
step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 
joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, 
Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox 
approach, reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by 
purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the secondary 
market at a substantial discount. The government had paid 100% of remaining 
official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France, and Spain. All commercial 
debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the long run, the government must 
press forward with general, market-oriented economic reforms.
