ECONOMY
Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt.
The economy has been devastated by widespread political instability,
mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor
with a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the
early 1970s, as does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important
sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the
major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the
government has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of
petroleum products, and improving civil service wages.  The policy changes are
especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in
1987, and boosting production and export earnings.  In 1990-92, the economy has
turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
exports, and gradually improving domestic security.
