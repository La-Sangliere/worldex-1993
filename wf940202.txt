ECONOMY 
Overview: The agricultural sector accounts for about 12% of GDP and

foreign exchange earnings in 1990. Mining is dominated by the extraction of 
phosphate, but production has faltered because of reduced worldwide demand for 
fertilizers in recent years. Over the past 10 years tourism has become 
increasingly important to the economy.
