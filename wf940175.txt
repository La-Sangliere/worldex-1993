ECONOMY 
Overview: Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing country, it 
remains poor with a $300 per capita GDP. In 1991-92 massive government 
spending, much of it to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, 
ballooned the budget deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. 
The lack of fiscal discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in 
compliance with an 18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos 
has set ambitious targets for expanding oil production capacity and is 
offering foreign companies more attractive investment incentives. Government 
efforts to reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain 
noninflationary growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new 
investment funds and endemic corruption. Living standards remain below the 
level of the early 1980s oil boom.
