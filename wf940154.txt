ECONOMY 
Overview: A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and 
livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many 
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 
1970s and 1980s.  Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account 
for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, 
however, has led to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are 
among the richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by 
foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater 
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the 
endemic conflict with Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement 
have resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has 
begun the second stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the 
World Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process 
suffered a major setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of 
Mauritania's support of SADDAM Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.
