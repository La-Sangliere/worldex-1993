ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on 
agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the 
population and account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the 
terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and 
expensive. The economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong 
trade and monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically 
backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development 
projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's 
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most important 
natural resources; however, the government limits the number of tourists to 
3,000/year to minimize foreign influence.
