ECONOMY 
Overview: Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of 
the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the 
countryside. In 1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40% of GDP. 
Agricultural products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the 
diamond industry for 30%. Important constraints to economic development 
include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a 
weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance, 
particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new 
investment.
