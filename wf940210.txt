ECONOMY 
Overview: Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population 
enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and educational standards equal 
to those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population 
suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment 
and lack of job skills. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich 
mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.  Economic developments 
in the 1990s will be driven partly by the changing relations among the various 
ethnic groups. The shrinking economy in recent years has absorbed less than 
10% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force annually. Local 
economists estimate that the economy must grow between 5% and 6% in real terms 
annually to absorb all of the new entrants.
