ECONOMY 
Overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural 
areas. Growth has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in 
global oil prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation. Banana 
exports, second only to oil, have suffered as a result of EC import quotas and 
banana blight. The new President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable 
attitude toward foreign investment than did his predecessor.  Ecuador has 
implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela and 
has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991, Ecuador received a 
standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit the country to proceed 
with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In September 1992, the government 
launched a new, macroeconomic program that gives more play to market forces; 
as of March 1993, the program seemed to be paying off.
