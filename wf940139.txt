ECONOMY 
Overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues 
from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and 
about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at 
$5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to 
changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource 
allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, although the 
reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the Libyan-Egyptian 
border in December 1989 have eased shortages. Austerity budgets and a lack of 
trained technicians have undermined the government's ability to implement a 
number of planned infrastructure development projects. Windfall revenues from 
the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign payments 
position and resulted in a current account surplus for the first time in five 
to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture 
accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic 
conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 
75% of its food requirements.
