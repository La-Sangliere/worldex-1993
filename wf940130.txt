ECONOMY 
Overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; 
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of 
manufactured goods.  State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even 
for a Communist country because of the small size and homogeneity of the 
society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic 
growth during the period 1984-88 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 3-5% 
annually during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in 
socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992, 
output dropped sharply, by perhaps 10-15%, as the economy felt the cumulative 
effect of the reduction in outside support. The leadership insisted in 
maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. 
Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the 
energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production. 
Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of industrial 
development since WWII. Output of the extractive industries includes coal, 
iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals. 
Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, including military industry, with 
light industry lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, 
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not 
yet become self-sufficient in food production. Five consecutive years of poor 
harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic food 
shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development 
and living standards.
