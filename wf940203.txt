SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO 
Note: Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint 
independent state, but this entity has not been formally recognized as a state 
by the US; the US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(SFRY) has dissolved and that none of the successor republics represents its 
continuation

ECONOMY 
Overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been followed 
by bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the 
breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and 
Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military 
strife. Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems. First, like the 
other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for large 
amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide varieties in 
climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology among the republics 
accentuate this interdependence, as did the Communist practice of 
concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The 
breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial 
plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in 
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the 
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and 
Montenegro is the continuation in office of a Communist government that is 
primarily interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform. A 
further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.

rainfall and a long growing season; produces fruit, grapes, and cereals; in 
this area, livestock production (sheep and cattle) and dairy farming prosper; 
Kosovo produces fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; 
the mountainous pastures of Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat
