ECONOMY
Overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed countries,
Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated
by the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock
accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and
seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihoods make up more
than half of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and
employs about 20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar,
sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial
sector is based on the processing of agricultural products and accounts for
less than 10% of GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-92 has
resulted in a substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.
