Flag: red with a white cross that extends to the edges of the flag; the 
vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side, and that design 
element of the DANNEBROG (Danish flag) was subsequently adopted by the other 
Nordic countries of Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden 
 
small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, 
comfortable living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark's 
new center-left coalition government will concentrate on reducing the 
persistent high unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as following 
the previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current 
account surplus. In the face of recent international market pressure on the 
Danish krone, the coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The 
coalition hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax 
revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax 
reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve welfare 
services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime Minister 
RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to EC's economic and 
monetary union (EMU) criteria by 1999, although Copenhagen won from the EC the 
right to opt out of the EMU if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is, 
in fact, one of the few EC countries likely to fit into the EMU on time. 
Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than many West 
European countries. As the EC's single market (formally established on 1 
January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth is expected to pickup to 
around 2% in 1993. Expected Danish approval of the Maastricht treaty on EC 
political and economic union in May 1993 would almost certainly reverse the 
drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current account surplus 
remains strong as limitations on wage increases and low inflation - expected 
to be around 1% in 1993 - improve export competitiveness. Although 
unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European countries.
