LEBANON 
Note: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political 
institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the 
devastating 16-year civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord - the 
blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established a more 
equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in 
the political process. Since December 1990, the Lebanese have formed three 
cabinets and conducted the first legislative election in 20 years. Most of the 
militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has 
seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and 
extended central government authority over about one-half of the country. 
Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, is the only significant group that retains 
most of its weapons.  Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel 
continues to support a proxy militia, The Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a 
narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave 
encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20 kilometers north to 
the strategic town of Jazzine. As of December 1992, Syria maintained about 
30,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North 
Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab 
League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the 
continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese 
Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, 
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.

ECONOMY 
Overview: Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic 
infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's 
position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Following October 1990, 
however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin 
restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port and 
government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by a 
financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale 
manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and farm 
exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main sources 
of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991, industrial 
production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial gains. The 
rests with the new, business-oriented Prime Minister HARIRI.
