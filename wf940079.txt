ECONOMY 
Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large 
subsistence sector.  Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and 
sugar processing accounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, 
including sugar milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned 
considerable sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each 
year. In 1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into 
decline. GDP dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political 
uncertainty created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century 
caused sugar production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned 
in strong performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 
the economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an 
estimated 21%. Sugar exports recovered in 1991-92.
