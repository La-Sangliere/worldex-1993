ECONOMY 
Overview: Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions 
rapidly increasing population, it remains a poor country. Real GDP growth in 
1985-92 averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash 
underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the labor 
force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important sector, 
accounting for almost 20% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The staple 
crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is now nearly 
self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and textiles and 
plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation. Industrial 
output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse 
natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. 
Of these, the oil sector dominates the external economy, generating more than 
20% of the government's revenues and 40% of export earnings in 1989. However, 
the economy's growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil 
exports. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of 
aid. Rapid growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement 
a tight monetary policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign 
banks for investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and 
off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta 
to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued 
problems in moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of 
a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 is estimated to have 
stayed at 6%.
