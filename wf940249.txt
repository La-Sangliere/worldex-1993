ECONOMY 
Overview: Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a 
united Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, 
is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends 
heavily on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. Former 
South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in 
Soviet economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture 
have made northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its 
essential needs. Large trade deficits have been compensated for by remittances 
from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food 
production, northern Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for 
export crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing 
qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export 
market. Oil export revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 
earnings by about $800 million.  Economic growth in former South Yemen has been 
constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control 
over production decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.
