ECONOMY 
Overview: The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of 
living in Europe, contracted sharply in 1991, with most industries producing 
at only a fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. 
For over 40 years, the Stalinist-type economy operated on the principle of 
central planning and state ownership of the means of production. Fitful 
economic reforms begun during 1991, including the liberalization of prices and 
trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform, were 
crippled by widespread civil disorder. Following its overwhelming victory in 
the 22 March 1992 elections, the new Democratic government announced a program 
of shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy. In 
an effort to expand international ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic 
relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and 
has joined the IMF and the World Bank. The Albanians have also passed 
legislation allowing foreign investment, but not foreign ownership of real 
estate. Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was 
largely self-sufficient in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 
1991 and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to 
maintain adequate supplies. In 1992 the government tightened budgetary contols 
leading to another drop in domestic output. The agricultural sector is 
steadily gaining from the privatization process. Low domestic output is 
supplemented by remittances from the 200,000 Albanians working abroad.
