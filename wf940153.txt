ECONOMY 
sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now 
used for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to 
France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, 
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers 
of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural 
exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is 
employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers launched 
protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and fears of greater 
competition in the European market from other producers.
