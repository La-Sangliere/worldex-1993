ECONOMY 
Overview: The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and 
natural resources make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the 
world.  Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict with 
Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 
level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 
80% of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Industry 
is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural products, including 
cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, with 
its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages. Oil 
companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in the 
south. Good crop weather led to 8.4% growth in 1991.
