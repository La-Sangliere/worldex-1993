ECONOMY 
Overview: One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has had a Communist 
centrally planned economy with government ownership and control of productive 
enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has been 
decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a 
landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no 
railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal 
telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area. 
Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of GDP 
and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice. 
For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its 
survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid from 
the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
