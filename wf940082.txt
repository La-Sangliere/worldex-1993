ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies 
and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry 
are the most important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish 
products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 
1987. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support 
an expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export.  Cultivation 
of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal 
area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily 
dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, 
particularly among younger workers.
