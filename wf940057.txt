Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners 
are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a 
fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development is 
hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack of 
natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is 
annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid. 
Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential 
and expanding the fishing industry.
