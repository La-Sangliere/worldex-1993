ECONOMY 
Overview: After an impressive economic performance through most of the 
1980s, Turkey has experienced erratic rates of economic growth since 1988 - 
ranging from a high of 9.2% in 1990 to a low of 0.9% in 1991. Strong consumer 
demand and increased public investment led the way to a strong 5.9% growth in 
1992.  Chronic high inflation is Turkey's most serious economic problem, 
leading to high interest rates and the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira. 
The huge public sector deficit - about 12% of GDP - and the Treasury's heavy 
reliance on Central Bank financing of the deficit are the major causes of 
Turkish inflation. Meanwhile, wage increases in both the public and private 
sector have outpaced productivity gains, limited the government's ability to 
reduce current expenditures, and hindered the return to profitability of many 
about 20% of exports. The government has launched a multibillion-dollar 
development program in the southeastern region, which includes the building of 
a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to generate electric power and 
irrigate large tracts of farmland. The Turkish economy will probably continue 
to grow faster than the West European average in 1993, but the shaky coalition 
government of Prime Minister DEMIREL - which has seen its parliamentary 
majority shrink from 36 to 11 seats during its first year in power - is 
unlikely to risk further erosion of its support by implementing the 
belt-tightening measures necessary to substantially reduce inflation.
