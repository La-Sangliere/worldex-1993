ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country 
gained independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production 
has gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 
1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a 
shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments 
problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm 
kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of 
exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense of 
other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs. It 
also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods.  Over the years, Sao 
Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to roughly 
80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for development of a 
1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule external debt service 
payments in cooperation with the International Development Association and 
Western lenders.
