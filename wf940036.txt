ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, 
is highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the 
national income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to 
companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, 
incorporation fees generated about $2 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 
1991 because of the poor performances of the tourist sector and tight 
commercial bank credit. Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural 
activity. The islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food 
requirements.
