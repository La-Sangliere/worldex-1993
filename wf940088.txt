ECONOMY 
Overview: Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia has been noted for 
its Black Sea tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and 
an industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2% of the USSR's 
output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing 
private sector (compared with the other republics). About 25% of the labor 
force is employed in agriculture. Mineral resources consist of manganese and 
copper, and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. 
Except for very small quantities of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be 
imported from neighboring republics. Oil and its products have been delivered 
by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and local 
refining. Gas has been supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol'. 
The dismantling of central economic controls has been delayed by political 
factionalism, marked by bitter armed struggles. In early 1993 the Georgian 
economy was operating at well less than half capacity due to disruptions in 
fuel supplies and vital transportation links as a result of conflicts in 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia, antigovernment activity in Western Georgia, and 
Azerbaijani pressure against Georgian assistance for Armenia. To restore 
economic viability, Georgia must establish domestic peace and must maintain 
economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while developing new links 
to the West.
