ECONOMY 
Overview: Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita 
income less than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on 
average at less than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 
1988-90. The decline resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the cane 
fields, and flooding and equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer 
prices rose about 100% in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account 
deficit widened substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, 
international financial agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to 
raise new funds. The government's stabilization program - aimed at 
establishing realistic exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a 
resumption of growth - requires considerable public administrative abilities 
and continued patience by consumers during a long incubation period. Buoyed by 
a recovery in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth in 1991 and 
7% growth in 1992, according to official figures. A large volume of illegal 
and quasi-legal economic activity is not captured in estimates of the 
country's total output.
