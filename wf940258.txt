ECONOMY
Overview: Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy remained
the same in 1992 as in 1991. Drought and power supply problems hampered
production, while inadequate revenues prevented government pump priming.
Despite a flat GDP performance, GNP mustered a small 0.6% expansion,
attributable to inflows of workers' remittances combined with smaller foreign
interest payments. A marked increase in capital goods imports, particularly
power generations equipment, telecommunications equipment, and electronic data
processors, contributed to a 20.5% import growth in 1992. Exports rose 11%,
led by earnings from the Philippines' two leading manufactures - electronics
and garments.
