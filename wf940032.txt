BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 
Note: Bosnia and Herzegovina is suffering from interethnic civil strife 
which began in March 1992 after the Bosnian Government held a referendum on 
independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia - responded 
with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines 
and joining Serb held areas to a "greater Serbia". Since the onset of the 
conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war population of 4.4 
million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats have 
asserted control of more than three-quarters of the territory formerly under 
the control of the Bosnian Government. The UN and the EC are continuing to try 
to mediate a plan for peace.

ECONOMY 
Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest 
republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost 
all in private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic 
traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly 
overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning 
and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in the 
republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's 
defense plants. As of March 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina was being torn apart 
by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that has caused production to 
plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No 
reliable economic statistics for 1992 are available, although output clearly 
fell below the already depressed 1991 level. 
 
National product: GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $14 billion (1991 
est.) 
 
National product real growth rate: -37% (1991 est.)

manganese, and bauxite), manufacturing (vehicle assembly, textiles, tobacco

Agriculture: accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces less 
than 50% of food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support orchards, 
vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters and heavy 
precipitation leach soil fertility reducing agricultural output in the 
mountains; farms are mostly privately held, small, and not very productive
