ECONOMY 
Overview: Industry, which accounts for about one-third of the labor force 
and generates over half the GDP, suffers from an aging capital plant and 
persistent shortages of energy. The year 1991 witnessed a 17% drop in 
industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor unrest. 
In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with flooding, 
mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the dismantling of 
cooperatives. A shortage of inputs and a severe drought in 1991 contributed to 
a poor harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and an obsolete 
distribution system. The new government has instituted moderate land reforms, 
with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and it has 
liberalized private agricultural output. Private enterprises form an 
increasingly important portion of the economy largely in services, 
handicrafts, and small-scale industry. Little progress on large scale 
privatization has been made since a law providing for the privatization of 
large state firms was passed in August 1991. Most of the large state firms 
have been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares and 
assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has halted the 
old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency export 
markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. The new government continues to 
impose price ceilings on key consumer items. In 1992 the economy muddled along 
toward the new, more open system, yet output and living standards continued to
