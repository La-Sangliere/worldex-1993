ECONOMY 
Overview: Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War 
I through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living 
under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. 
It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external 
communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore 
constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward 
foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial 
output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and 
exports. In the last few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable 
picture has been clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual 
loss of competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister 
BILDT'S center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with 
free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost 13% of 
GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have forestalled many of the 
plans. Unemployment in 1993 is forecast at around 7% with another 5% in job 
training. Continued heavy foreign exchange speculation forced the government 
to cooperate in late 1992 with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis 
packages - one a severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur 
industrial competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. 
In November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has 
since depreciated around 2.5% against the dollar.  The government hopes the 
in the economy, BILDT continues to propose cuts in welfare benefits, 
subsidies, defense, and foreign aid.  Sweden continues to harmonize its 
economic policies with those of the EC in preparation for concluding its EC 
membership bid by 1995.
