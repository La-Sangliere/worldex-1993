ECONOMY 
Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today 
closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic 
system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the impressive growth of 
the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from 
a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, 
Canada registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD 
nations, averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor 
force, and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. 
However, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and 
French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the 
confederation; foregn investors have become edgy.
