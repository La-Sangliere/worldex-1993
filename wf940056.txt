ECONOMY 
Overview: Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and 
A reform program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties 
in 1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime 
and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay 
of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and exports. 
In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance 
large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the 
highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however, growth has slowed 
to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the population growth rate. 
The new government, responding to pressure from businessmen and the 
electorate, has promised to reduce the bureaucracy and government regulation 
but little has been accomplished as of early 1993.
