ECONOMY 
Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of 
the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology 
companies and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in 
expanding employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, 
agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in 
their shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing 
about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to 
European Community markets.
