WEST BANK 
Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with 
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the 
Golan Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by 
President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a 
peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the 
concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will 
resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process, it 
is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet 
to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of 
the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 
Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status 
and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of 
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West 
Bank.

ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli 
military administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising 
(intifadah).  Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable 
investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive 
Israeli policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, 
not productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli 
industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers employed 
in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf dropped 
dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the 
Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, 
increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of the loss 
of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to curtail the 
intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards. The 
area's economic outlook remains bleak.
