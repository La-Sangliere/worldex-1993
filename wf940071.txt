ECONOMY 
Overview: The agricultural sector accounts for 24% of GDP, employs about 
40% of the labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is 
the major commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export earnings. The 
manufacturing sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts 
for 18% of GDP and 15% of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla 
sabotage total more than $2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a 
large military seriously constrain the government's efforts to provide 
essential social services. Nevertheless, growth in national output during the 
period 1990-92 exceeded growth in population for the first time since 1987.
