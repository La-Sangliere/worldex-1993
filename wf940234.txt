ECONOMY 
Overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most 
important economic component of the former Soviet Union producing more than 
three times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil 
generated more than one fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms 
provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other 
republics. Likewise, its well-developed and diversified heavy industry 
supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other 
regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the Ukrainian government liberalized most 
prices and erected a legal framework for privatizing state enterprises while 
retaining many central economic controls and continuing subsidies to state 
production enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA 
launched a new economic reform program promising more freedom to the 
agricultural sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises, and 
stricter control over state subsidies. Even so, the magnitude of the problems 
and the slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions preclude a 
near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level.
