ECONOMY 
Overview: About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock 
raising, activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy 
also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium 
production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s 
when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany, Japan, 
and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for uranium has 
contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe trade 
imbalance, and a mounting external debt.
