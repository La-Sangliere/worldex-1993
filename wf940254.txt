ECONOMY
Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing
sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an
unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction.  In
addition, the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected
by substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial
and mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990, launched
an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and reinvigorate the
economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy, and opening it to
increased foreign competition. The government also obtained an IMF standby
loan in January 1992 and reached agreements with commercial bankers on the
repayment of interest arrears and on the reduction of debt and debt service
payments. Galloping inflation - the rate doubled in 1992 - continues to
undermine economic stability.  Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency
following President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992, has promised to
support the basic premises of COLLOR'S reform program but has yet to define
clearly his economic policies. Brazil's natural resources remain a major,
long-term economic strength.
