ECONOMY 
Overview: The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light 
industry and tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the 
service sector 45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. 
The sale of postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. 
Low business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules 
have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to 
establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated 
solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied 
closely to Switzerland's economy in a customs union, and incomes and living 
standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.
