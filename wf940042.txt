ECONOMY 
Overview: Cambodia remains a desperately poor country whose economic 
recovery is held hostage to continued political unrest and factional 
hostilities. The country's immediate economic challenge is an acute financial 
crisis that is undermining monetary stability and preventing disbursement of 
foreign development assistance. Cambodia is still recovering from an abrupt 
shift in 1990 to free-market economic mechanisms and a cutoff in aid from 
former Soviet bloc countries; these changes have severely impacted on public 
sector revenues and performance. The country's infrastructure of roads, 
bridges, and power plants has been severely degraded, now having only 40-50% 
of prewar capacity. The economy remains essentially rural, with 90% of the 
population living in the countryside and dependent mainly on subsistence 
agriculture. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and 
unreliable.
