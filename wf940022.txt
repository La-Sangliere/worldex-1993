ECONOMY 
Overview: Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely 
populated, and least developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly 
agricultural. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and 
floods, government interference with the economy, a rapidly growing labor 
force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, a low level of 
industrialization, failure to fully exploit energy resources (natural gas), 
and inefficient and inadequate power supplies. An excellent rice crop and 
expansion of the export garment industry helped growth in FY91/92. Policy 
reforms intended to reduce government regulation of private industry and 
promote public-sector efficiency have been announced but are being implemented 
only slowly.
