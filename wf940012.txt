ECONOMY 
Overview: Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built 
up textile, machine-building, and other industries and had become a key 
supplier to sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw 
materials and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter 
the republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy 
has been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave within 
the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright warfare, the 
strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the Azerbaijani 
railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered Armenians in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed about one-tenth of 
industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has not been possible 
because the supply of funds and real resources has been disrupted by the 
reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central USSR administrative 
apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the earthquake are the 
Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of Armenia's needs for 
electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of the output of 
elevators in the former USSR.  Armenia has some deposits of nonferrous metal 
ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are largely unexploited. For 
in a chaotic state of transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is 
attributable largely to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular 
importance was the shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links 
to Russia through Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.
