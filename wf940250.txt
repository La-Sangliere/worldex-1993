ECONOMY 
Overview: In 1992, Zaire's formal economy continued to disintegrate. While 
meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, 
the largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have made 
the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions are conducted 
in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost almost all value, and a 
barter economy now flourishes in all but the largest cities.  Most individuals 
and families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade. The 
government has not been able to meet its financial obligations to the 
International Momentary Fund or put in place the financial measures advocated 
by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for improvement are dim, improved 
political stability would boost Zaire's long-term potential to effectively 
exploit its vast wealth of mineral and agricultural resources.
