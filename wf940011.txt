ECONOMY 
Overview: Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate 
population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified 
industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist 
policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge external debts 
and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of 
recession, President MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic 
restructuring program that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of 
stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US 
dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 
years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by 
repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. Much remains 
to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth and 
in solidifying the recent economic gains.
