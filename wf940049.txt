ECONOMY 
Overview: The government of President AYLWIN, which took power in 1990, 
retained the economic policies of PINOCHET, although the share of spending for 
social welfare has risen steadily. In 1991 growth in GDP recovered to 6% (led 
by consumer spending) after only 2% growth in 1990. The pace accelerated in 
1992 as the result of strong investment and export growth, and GDP rose 10.4%. 
Nonetheless, inflation fell further, to 12.7%, compared with 27.3% in 1990 and 
18.7% in 1991. The buoyant economy spurred a 25% growth in imports, and the 
trade surplus fell in 1992, although international reserves increased. 
Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1993, and economic 
growth is likely to approach 7%.
