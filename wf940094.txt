ECONOMY 
Overview: Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult and 
unemployment increases. Prospects for economic growth in the immediate future 
are not bright. The Home Rule Government's economic restraint measures 
introduced in the late 1980s have assisted in shifting red figures into a 
balance in the public budget. Foreign trade produced a surplus in 1989 and 
1990, but has now returned to a deficit. Following the closing of the Black 
Angel lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland today is fully dependent on 
fishing and fish processing, this sector accounting for 95% of exports. 
Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp catches will 
at best stabilize and cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and 
hydrocarbon activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism 
with some potential for the near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e. 
the HRG and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant 
role in Greenland accounting for about two thirds of total employment. About 
half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.
