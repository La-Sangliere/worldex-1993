ECONOMY 
Overview: The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been 
the planned development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously 
entrepreneurial society. Real GNP increased more than 10% annually between 
1986 and 1991.  This growth ultimately led to an overheated situation 
characterized by a tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a 
rapidly rising current account deficit. As a result, in 1992, focusing 
attention on slowing the growth rate of inflation and reducing the deficit is 
leading to a slow-down in growth. The economy remains the envy of the great 
majority of the world's peoples.
