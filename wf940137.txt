ECONOMY 
Overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important 
natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light 
manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($439 
million in 1991). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods from 
subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on farm 
products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other 
industries include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular, a major 
water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to South 
Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. 
Political and economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for 
Lesotho's economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances - 
recently the equivalent of nearly three-fourths of domestic output.
