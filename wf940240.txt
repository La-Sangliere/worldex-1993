ECONOMY 
Overview: Petroleum is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 23% of 
GDP, 70% of central government revenues, and 82% of export earnings in 1992. 
President PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he assumed 
office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and the removal of price controls, a 
free market exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy 
into confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy 
recovered part way in 1990 and grew by 10.4% in 1991 and 7.3% in 1992, led by 
the non-petroleum sector.
