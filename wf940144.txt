ECONOMY 
Overview: Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a 
dissolved Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through 
its own agricultural and coal resources. It will, however, move down toward a 
bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are reforged or enlarged 
with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria.  The 
economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and its modern 
machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both internally and in the 
region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and 
economic programs. Inflation in early 1992 was out of control, the result of 
fracturing trade links, the decline in economic activity, and general 
uncertainties about the future status of the country; prices rose 38% in March 
1992 alone. In August 1992, Greece, angry at the use of "Macedonia" as the 
republic's name, imposed a partial blockade for several months. This blockade, 
combined with the effects of the UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, cost 
the economy approximately $1 billion in 1992 according to official figures. 
Macedonia's geographical isolation, technological backwardness, and potential 
political instability place it far down the list of countries of interest to 
Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece and an internal 
commitment to economic reform would help to encourage foreign investment over 
the long run. In the immediate future, the worst scenario for the economy 
would be the spread of fighting across its borders.
