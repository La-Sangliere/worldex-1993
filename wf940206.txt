ECONOMY 
Overview: Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong 
service and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links 
derived from its entrepot history. The economy appears to have pulled off a 
soft landing from the 9% growth rate of the late 1980s, registering higher 
than expected growth in 1992 while stemming inflation. Economic activity 
slowed early in 1992, primarily as a result of slackened demand in Singapore's 
export markets. But after bottoming out in the second quarter, the economy 
picked up in line with a gradual recovery in the United States. The year's 
best performers were the construction and financial services industries and 
manufacturers of computer-related components. Rising labor costs continue to 
be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications that 
productivity is catching up. Government surpluses and the rate of gross 
national savings remain high. In technology, per capita output, and labor 
discipline, Singapore is well on its way toward its goal of becoming a 
developed country.
