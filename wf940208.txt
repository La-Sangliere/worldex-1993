ECONOMY 
Overview: Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav 
republics, with a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, 
indeed not far below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of 
its strong ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during its 
fight for independence from Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects 
among the former Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few 
years. The dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term 
dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties.  For example, overall 
industrial production fell 10% in 1991; particularly hard hit were the iron 
and steel, machine-building, chemical, and textile industries. Meanwhile, the 
continued fighting in other former Yugoslavian republics has led to further 
destruction of long-established trade channels and to an influx of tens of 
spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's comparatively 
well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and its Western 
business attitudes, but instability in Croatia is a deterrent. Slovenia in 
absolute terms is a small economy, and a little Western investment would go a 
long way.
