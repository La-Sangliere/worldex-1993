local long form: Republica del Peru 
 
local short form: Peru 
 
Digraph: PE 
 
Type: republic

Administrative divisions: 24 departments (departamentos, singular - 
departamento) and 1 constitutional province* (provincia constitucional); 
Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, 
Huancavelica, Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, 
Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura, Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes,

note: the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990 
mandate the creation of regions (regiones, singular - region) intended to 
function eventually as autonomous economic and administrative entities; so 
far, 12 regions have been constituted from 23 existing departments - Amazonas 
Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los 
Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui (from 
Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca, 
Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of 
another region has been delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional 
province of Callao to merge with the department of Lima; because of inadequate 
funding from the central government, the regions have yet to assume their 
responsibilities and at the moment coexist with the departmental structure

ECONOMY 
Overview: The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, 
with a large dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and 
banking. In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per 
capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and 
World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An 
austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took 
office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of 
economic activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% 
in 1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated 
government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the single-digit 
level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima 
obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 
1991, although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By 
working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and 
arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993. In 
1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current 
resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch.  Meanwhile, revival of growth in GDP 
continued to be restricted by the large amount of public and private resources 
being devoted to strengthening internal security.
