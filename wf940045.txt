ECONOMY 
Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource 
base, a serious, long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is 
service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 
60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, 
agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%. 
About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and 
tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. 
Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from 
emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the new democratic 
government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the private sector and 
attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.
