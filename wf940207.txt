ECONOMY 
Overview: The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent states - 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the task 
of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old 
Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European standards, 
suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in 
energy and many raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after 
state-owned and controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these 
measures resulted in privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic 
activity and the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a 
cost in inflation, unemployment, and lower output.  For Czechoslovakia as a 
whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992 in 
Slovakia, inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated fall in GDP 
was a more moderate 7%. In 1993 the government anticipates up to a 7% drop in 
GDP, with the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably 
accounting for half the decline; inflation, according to government 
projections, may rise to 15-20% and unemployment may reach 12-15%. The Slovak 
government is moving ahead less enthusiastically than the Czech government in 
the further dismantling of the old centrally controlled economic system. 
Although the governments of Slovakia and the Czech Republic had envisaged 
retaining the koruna as a common currency at least in the short run, the two 
countries ended the currency union in February 1993.
