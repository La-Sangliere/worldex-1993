ECONOMY 
Overview: In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for 
example, in its industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of 
living, and its critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for 
fuels and raw materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former 
Soviet republics, having produced 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the 
labor force in the old USSR. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies 
important producer and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to 
the other states. Belarus had a significant share of the machine-building 
capacity of the former USSR. It is especially noted for production of 
tractors, large trucks, machine tools, and automation equipment. The soil in 
Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by emphasizing 
favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens), Belarus has 
become a net exporter to the other former republics of meat, milk, eggs, 
flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and gas and 
receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil pipeline and the 
Northern Lights gas pipeline.  These pipelines transit Belarus en route to 
Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals, plastics, synthetic fibers 
peat (more than one-third of the total for the former Soviet Union) is used in 
domestic heating, as boiler fuel for electric power stations, and in the 
production of chemicals. The potash supports fertilizer production. In 1992 
GDP fell an estimated 13%, largely because the country is highly dependent on 
the ailing Russian economy for raw materials and parts.
