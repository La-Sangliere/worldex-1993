ECONOMY 
Overview: Government control of the economy historically has been 
extensive, although the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce 
intervention. Four private banks have been licensed, and the government has 
liberalized foreign trade and abolished price controls on most goods. In early 
1993, fewer than 50% of the agricultural and industrial firms remain state 
owned.  Sandinista economic policies and the war had produced a severe economic 
crisis. The foundation of the economy continues to be the export of 
agricultural commodities, largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by 
roughly 7% in 1989 and 4% in 1990, and remained about even in 1991-92.  The 
agricultural sector employs 44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP 
and 80% of export earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and 
contributes about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in 
1990, and remained flat in 1991-92; output still is below pre-1979 levels. 
External debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In 
1992 the inflation rate was 8%, down sharply from the 766% of 1991.
