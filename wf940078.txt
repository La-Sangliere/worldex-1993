ECONOMY 
Overview: The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards 
of the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the 
all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita 
external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world extended their 
fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer 
could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and subsequently 
depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight controls on 
fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy 
cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which has already 
been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its 
annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands' budget 
revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to balance their 
budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to continue its tough 
policies, including introducing a 20% VAT in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF 
economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual subsidy, the 
Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe bank to the tune of 
$140 million since October 1992.
