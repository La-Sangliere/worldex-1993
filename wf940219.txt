ECONOMY 
Overview: Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in 
the world - is nonetheless undergoing a painful adjustment after both the 
soft economy have afflicted Switzerland. Despite slow growth in 1991-92, the 
Swiss central bank had been unable to ease monetary policy in the past three 
years because of the threat to the Swiss franc posed by high German interest 
rates. As a result, unemployment is forecast to rise from 3% in 1992 to more 
than 4% in 1993, with inflation moving down from 4% to 3%. The voters' 
rejection in December 1992 of a referendum on membership in the EEA which was 
supported by most political, business, and financial leaders has raised doubts 
that the country can maintain its preeminent prosperity and leadership in 
commercial banking in the 21st century.  Despite these problems, Swiss per 
capita output, general living standards, education and science, health care, 
and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe.  The country has few natural resources 
except for the scenic natural beauty that has made it a world leader in 
tourism. Management-labor relations remain generally harmonious.
