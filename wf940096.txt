ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and 
services.  It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. 
Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an 
increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally 
important sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as 
bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and 
flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, 
although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly 
from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most 
manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high 
among the young.
