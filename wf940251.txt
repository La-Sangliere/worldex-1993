ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with 
falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a 
chronically depressed level of copper production and ineffective economic 
policies. In 1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more. An annual 
population growth of more than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 
50% over the past decade. A high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's 
economic woes in recent years, as well as severe drought in the crop year 
1991/92.
