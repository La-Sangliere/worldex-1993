ECONOMY 
largest global producer. Moscow's push for ever-increasing amounts of cotton 
had included massive irrigation projects which caused extensive environmental 
damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic. Furthermore, the lavish use 
of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive pollution and widespread health 
problems. Recently the republic has sought to encourage food production at the 
expense of cotton. The small industrial sector specializes in such items as 
agricultural machinery, mineral fertilizers, vegetable oil, and bridge cranes. 
Uzbekistan also has some important natural resources including gold (about 30% 
of former Soviet production), uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek Government 
has encouraged some land reform but has shied away from other aspects of 
economic reform. Output and living standards continued to fall in 1992 largely 
because of the cumulative impact of disruptions in supply that have followed 
the dismemberment of the USSR.
