ECONOMY 
Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable socialist market economy 
with a sizable proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare 
benefits.  Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled 
labor force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies 
specialized niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and 
produces almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in 
agriculture. Increased export sales resulting from German unification, 
continued to boost Austria's economy through 1991. However, Germany's economic 
difficulties in 1992 slowed Austria's GDP growth to 2% from the 3% of 1991. 
Austria's economy, moreover, is not expected to grow by more than 1% in 1993, 
and inflation is forecast to remain about 4%. Unemployment will likely remain 
at current levels at least until 1994. Living standards in Austria are 
comparable with the large industrial countries of Western Europe. Problems for 
the l990s include an aging population, the high level of subsidies, and the 
struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary capabilities. The continued 
opening of Eastern European markets, however, will increase demand for 
Austrian exports. Austria, a member of the European Free Trade Association 
services to the EFTA countries, and Austrians plan to hold a national 
referendum within the next two years to vote on EC membership.
