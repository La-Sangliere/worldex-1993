ECONOMY 
Overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership 
of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale 
private trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, 
Iran's real GDP grew by 10% in FY90 and 6% in FY91, according to Iranian 
Government statistics. An oil windfall in 1990 combined with a substantial 
increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic growth. Iran has 
also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to reduce government 
intervention (including subsidies) and has allocated substantial resources to 
development projects in the hope of stimulating the economy. Lower oil 
revenues in 1991 - oil accounts for more than 90% of export revenues - 
together with a surge in imports greatly weakened Iran's international 
financial position. By mid-1992 Iran was unable to meet its obligations to 
foreign creditors. Subsequently the government has tried to boost oil exports, 
curb imports (especially of consumer goods), and renegotiate terms of its 
foreign debts.
