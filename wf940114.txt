Resolution 687, which demands that Iraq accept the inviolability of the 
boundary set forth in its 1963 agreement with Kuwait, ending earlier claims to 
Bubiyan and Warbah Islands or to all of Kuwait; the 20 May 1993 final report 
of the UN Iraq/Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission was welcomed by the 
Security Council in Resolution 833 of 27 May 1993, which also reaffirmed that

ECONOMY 
Overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and 
management of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some 
small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. 
The economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally 
provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial 
problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and 
damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement 
austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt 
payments. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually 
increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged 
facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, 
salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and 
collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high 
priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's 
seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, 
and military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 
drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and transportation 
facilities suffered severe damage and have been only partially restored. Oil 
exports remain at less than 10% of the previous level. Shortages of spare 
parts continue. Living standards deteriorated even further in 1992 and early 
1993; consumer prices at least tripled in 1992. The UN-sponsored economic 
embargo has reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise 
in prices. The government's policies of supporting large military and internal 
security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters of the regime 
have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output in early 1993 is far 
below the 1989-90 level, but no reliable estimate is available.
