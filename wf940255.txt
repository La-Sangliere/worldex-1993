ECONOMY
Overview: About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture
is mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of
the work force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to
safe drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil erosion
and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the Organization of
American States in response to the September 1991 coup against President
ARISTIDE have further damaged the economy.
