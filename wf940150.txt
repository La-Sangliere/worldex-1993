ECONOMY 
Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic 
location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its 
food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy 
sources.  Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and 
services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the 
economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and 
textile industries major contributors and the state-owned Malta drydocks 
employing about 4,300 people. In 1991, about 900,000 tourists visited the 
island. Per capita GDP at $7,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of 
the world's nations.
