ECONOMY 
Overview: Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces 
enormous problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based 
central planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private entrepreneurs, 
local government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process 
requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and 
monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily 
weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas and 
1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet republics in 
cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region, where the huge 
Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya. The general decline in national product 
accelerated in 1992, principally because of inability to obtain spare parts 
and disputes with customers over the price of natural gas.
