ECONOMY 
Overview: Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third 
World economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government. 
Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.  Even 
so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in 
1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of debt 
servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments 
support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was 
suspended in early 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised 
reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a 
structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-92 the 
government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing 
exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural reforms 
like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy has not gained 
momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem. In 1992-93 tourism has 
plunged 20% or so because of sporadic attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist 
groups.  President MUBARAK has cited population growth as the main cause of the 
country's economic troubles. The addition of about 1.4 million people a year 
to the already huge population of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 
5% of the land area available for agriculture.
