ECONOMY 
Overview: Moldova, the next-to-smallest of the former Soviet republics in 
area, is the most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1% of the 
population, labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. 
Living standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country 
enjoys a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based 
on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry 
accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than 
one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on other 
former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic equipment, 
machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles. Its industrial 
and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the other republics. 
Moldova has freed prices on most goods and has legalized private ownership of 
property. Moldova's near-term economic prospects are dimmed, however, by the 
difficulties of moving toward a market economy, the political problems of 
redefining ties to the other former Soviet republics and Romania, and the 
ongoing separatist movements in the Dniester and Gagauz regions. In 1992, 
national output fell substantially for the second consecutive year - down 22% 
in the industrial sector and 20% in agriculture. The decline is mainly 
attributable to the drop in energy supplies.
