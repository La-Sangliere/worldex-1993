ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and 
fishing.  The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for 
high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the 
remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder 
development. Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of 
revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the l990s. 
Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major 
impediments to long-term growth.
