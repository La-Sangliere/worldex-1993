ECONOMY 
Overview: With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia 
continues to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least 
developed countries in Africa. (The accompanying analysis and figures predate 
the independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture, 
which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total 
employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing sector 
is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of 
large-scale industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the 
government is considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants. 
Favorable agricultural weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in 
FY89, whereas drought and deteriorating internal security conditions prevented 
growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, 
interfered with economic development and growth.  In 1992, because of some 
easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world, the economy 
substantially improved.
