ECONOMY 
Overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, 
after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per 
capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps one-third 
above the Yugoslav average. Croatian Serb Nationalists control approximately 
one third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding determinants of 
Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution of 
this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental problems stemming from: the 
legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; 
damage during the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and 
houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the 
disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics, 
as well as within its own territory. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and 
investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary 
to salvage a desperate economic situation. However, peace and political 
stability must come first. As of June 1993, fighting continues among Croats, 
Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries and final political arrangements 
are still in doubt.
