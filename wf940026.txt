ECONOMY 
Overview: This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its 
central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and 
diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in 
the populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging 
reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources 
Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely 
dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC 
countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, but 
economic growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92. The economy is expected to 
turn in another sluggish 1% performance in 1993. Belgium's public debt remains 
high at 120% of GDP and the government is trying to control its expenditures 
to bring the figure more into line with other industrialized countries.
