ECONOMY
Overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular
resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The
Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and small,
high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low
business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have
established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses
and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes
on hotels, banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from
tourism. Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in
prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.
