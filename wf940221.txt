ECONOMY 
Overview: Tajikistan has had the lowest living standards of the CIS 
republics and now faces the bleakest economic prospects. Agriculture 
(particularly cotton and fruit growing) is the most important sector, 
accounting for 38% of employment (1990). Industrial production includes 
aluminum reduction, hydropower generation, machine tools, refrigerators, and 
freezers.  Throughout 1992 bloody civil disturbances disrupted food imports and 
several regions became desperately short of basic needs. Hundreds of thousands 
of people were made homeless by the strife. In late 1992, one-third of 
industry was shut down and the cotton crop was only one-half of that of 1991.
