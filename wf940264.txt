ECONOMY

Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The
islands are too small and too remote for development of a tourist industry.
Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
supported also by Japan and South Korea.
