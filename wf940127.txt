ECONOMY 
Overview: Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest 
annually averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions 
and a shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the 
leading economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume,

population growth figure, and in 1992 output fell.
