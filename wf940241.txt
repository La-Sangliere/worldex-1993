ECONOMY 
Overview: Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving 
away from the planned economic model and toward a more effective market-based 
economic system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled and the Vietnamese 
currency has been effectively devalued and floated at world market rates. In 
addition, the scope for private sector activity has been expanded, primarily 
through decollectivization of the agricultural sector and introduction of laws 
giving legal recognition to private business. Despite such positive 
indicators, the country's economic turnaround remains tenuous. Nearly 
three-quarters of export earnings are generated by only two commodities, rice 
and crude oil. Meanwhile, industrial production stagnates, burdened by 
uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to 
privatize. Unemployment looms as the most serious problem with over 25% of the 
workforce without jobs and population growth swelling the ranks of the 
unemployed yearly.
