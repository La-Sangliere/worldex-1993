ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy, devastated during the regime of former President 
Macias NGUEMA, is based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account 
for about half of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture 
predominates, with cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign 
exchange, and government revenues. There is little industry.  Commerce accounts 
for about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors 
for about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, 
manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under 
concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately 
successful. Increased production from recently discovered natural gas deposits 
will provide a greater share of exports by 1995.
