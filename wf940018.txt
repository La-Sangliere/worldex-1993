ECONOMY 
Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or 
Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian 
states in its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and 
low standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil, 
and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for 
several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate the 
funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest, marked by 
armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim Azeris and 
Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan accounted for 
1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union. 
Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in 
making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its considerable 
economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to consume 25% of 
Azerbaijan's economic resources.
