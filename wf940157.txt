ECONOMY 
Overview: Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial 
facilities (notably oil), private manufacturing and services, and both 
large-scale and traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced 
severe economic difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as 
world petroleum prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic 
food supply; and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became 
more acute. Growth in national output, however, has recovered, rising from 
1.4% in 1988 to 4% in 1990 and 3.6% in 1991 and coming in at 2.6% in 1992.  The 
US is Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for almost three-quarters of 
its exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and tourism 
are the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in consultation 
than two-thirds of its state-owned companies (parastatals), including banks. 
In 1991-92 the government conducted negotiations with the US and Canada on a 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was still being discussed 
by the three countries in early 1993. In January 1993, Mexico replaced its old 
peso with a new peso, at the rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso. Notwithstanding 
the palpable improvements in economic performance in the early 1990s, Mexico 
faces substantial problems for the remainder of the decade - e.g., rapid 
population growth, unemployment, and serious pollution, particularly in Mexico 
City.
