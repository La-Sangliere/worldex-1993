ECONOMY 
Overview: Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned 
economy inherited from the former USSR into a market economy. Prices have been 
freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural 
resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most valuable 
economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and disciplined 
than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly 
diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer 
electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its 
electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial ties 
to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward joint 
is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in grain and 
potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the former USSR. Good 
relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians (34% 
of the population) and native Latvians. The cumulative difficulties in 
replacing old sources of supply and old markets, together with the phasing out 
of the Russian ruble as the medium of exchange, help account for the sharp 30% 
drop in GDP in 1992.
