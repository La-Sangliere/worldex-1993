ECONOMY 
Overview: The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. 
Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of 
GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, 
which accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of 
raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond 
mining provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from 
high unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing 
dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to get 
the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic policy in 
line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since March 1991, 
however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and eastern Sierra 
Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined efforts to 
institute economic reforms.
