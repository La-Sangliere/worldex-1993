ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most 
important determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real 
GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct 
contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors - 
particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities.  Although 
Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a 
labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it has been hurt in 1991-92 by 
a downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
