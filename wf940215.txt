ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts 
for 15% of GDP and about 70% of export earnings. The economy has been in 
trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world bauxite 
prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986 was 
and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990 reflected 
continued political instability and deterred investment and economic reform. 
High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and hard 
currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
