ECONOMY 
Overview: As of June 1993 Estonia ranks first among the 15 former Soviet 
republics in moving from its obsolete command economy to a modern market 
economy. Yet serious problems remain. In contrast to the estimated 30% drop in 
output in 1992, GDP should grow by a small percent in 1993. Of key importance 
has been the introduction of the kroon in August 1993 and the subsequent 
reductions in inflation to 1%-2% per month. Starting in July 1991, under a new 
law on private ownership, small enterprises, such as retail shops and 
restaurants, were sold to private owners. The auctioning of large-scale 
enterprises is progressing with the proceeds being held in escrow until the 
prior ownership (that is, Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) 
can be established. Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the 
former Soviet republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat 
production, and provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the 
work force is in agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in 
manufactures are of high quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to 
the other republics. Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits 
of shale oil (60% of the old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million 
tons). Estonia has a large, relatively modern port and produces more than half 
of its own energy needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. It has 
advantages in the transition, not having suffered so long under the Soviet 
yoke and having better chances of developing profitable ties to the Nordic and 
West European countries. Like Latvia, but unlike Lithuania, the large portion 
of ethnic Russians (30%) in the population poses still another difficulty in 
the transition to an independent market economy.
