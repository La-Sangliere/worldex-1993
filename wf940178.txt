ECONOMY 
Overview: Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free 
market activity and government intervention. The government controls key 
areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state 
enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with 
sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps 
propel public sector expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and 
results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small 
country with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an 
exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- 
and medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The 
country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, 
fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to 
keep its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is 
to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years 
to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and 
diversify the economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary budgets. 
The budget deficit is expected to hit a record 8% of GDP because of welfare 
spending and bail-outs of the banking system. Unemployment continues at record 
levels of over 10% - including those in job programs - because of the weakness 
of the economy outside the oil sector. Overall economic growth is expected to 
be around 2% in 1993 while inflation is likely to rise slightly to 4%. Oslo, a 
member of the European Free Trade Area, has applied for EC membership and 
continues to deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the 
European Economic Area (EEA) - which creates an EC/EFTA market with free 
movement of capital, goods, services, and labor - to take effect in late 1993 
and its EC bid.
