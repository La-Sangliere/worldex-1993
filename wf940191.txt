ECONOMY
Overview: The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.
Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years
amounted to one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the
well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social
tensions.  The white and Indian communities are substantially better off than
other segments of the population, often approaching European standards,
whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the
poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in
February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The
economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial
assistance from France.
