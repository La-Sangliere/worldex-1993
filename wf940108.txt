ECONOMY 
Overview: Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition from a command 
to a market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable 
export earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 
40% of GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 25% of foreign 
trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD members. 
Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it a head 
start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment. In 1991, 
Hungary received 60% of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe, and in 1992 
received the largest single share. The growing private sector accounts for 
about one-third of national output according to unofficial estimates. 
Privatization of state enterprises is progressing, although excessive red 
tape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about pricing have slowed the 
process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of inflation may impede 
efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform, while Hungary's heavy 
foreign debt will make the government reluctant to introduce full 
convertibility of the forint before 1994 and to rein in inflation. The 
government is projecting an end to the 5-year recession in 1993, and GDP is 
forecast to grow 0%-3%.
