ECONOMY 
Overview: The stable economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and 
negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly productive 
family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently dominated by steel, 
has become increasingly more diversified, particularly toward high-technology 
firms. During the past decade, growth in the financial sector has more than 
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account 
for a growing proportion of the economy.  Luxembourg participates in an 
economic union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters and is also 
closely connected economically to the Netherlands.
