ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with the 
country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast 
Africa.  Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and 
an international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural 
resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on 
foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance 
development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a major 
problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last five 
years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including 
immigrants and refugees).
