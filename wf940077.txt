ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or 
indirectly employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet 
domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily 
those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade 
wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish 
in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So 
far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. 
In 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers 
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone.  These license fees 
amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income 
for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development 
Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant 
wildlife and trout fishing.
