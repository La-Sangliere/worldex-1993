ECONOMY 
Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to 
move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a 
more productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within 
the framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities 
have switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place 
of the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and 
plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise 
in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign economic sector to 
increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying result has been a 
strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. 
Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong 
Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern production 
methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods. 
Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the darker side, the 
leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of 
socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall 
gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, 
retightening central controls at intervals and thereby lessening the 
credibility of the reform process. In 1991, and again in 1992, output rose 
substantially, particularly in the favored coastal areas. Popular resistance, 
long-term economic viability.
