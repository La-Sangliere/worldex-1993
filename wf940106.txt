ECONOMY 
Overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or 
nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials 
must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of 
the labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged 
a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% 
in 1991 and 5.9% in 1992. Unemployment, which has been declining since the 
mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward 
pressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain bright 
so long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably prosperous.
