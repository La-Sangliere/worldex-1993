Flag: three equal vertical bands of green (hoist side), red, and yellow

highest incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the 
serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political 
instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate 
for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid economic 
growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986 
precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, 
and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and 
inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support 
from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms 
designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and 
recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by opposition 
parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.
