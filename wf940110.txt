ECONOMY 
Overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, 
modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a 
multitude of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s permitted a 
significant increase in real per capita private consumption. A large share of 
the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford an adequate 
diet. Financial strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted government austerity 
measures that slowed industrial growth but permitted India to meet its 
international payment obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy 
reforms since 1991 have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly 
reduced government controls on production, trade, and investment.
