ECONOMY 
Overview: Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been 
implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including moves 
toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily dependent 
on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not spread 
substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending peacekeeping 
forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a democratic government 
have boosted government expenditures and undercut structural adjustment 
reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.  Meanwhile, declining world 
commodity prices for Ghana's exports has placed the government under severe 
financial pressure.
