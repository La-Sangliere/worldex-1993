ECONOMY 
Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market 
economy, with per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic 
sector is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering 
industries.  Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 
30% of GDP.  Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports 
of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because 
of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining 
self-sufficiency in basic products. The economy, which experienced an average 
of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into deep recession in 1991 
as growth contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which continued in 1992 with 
growth contracting by 3.5% - has been caused by economic overheating, 
depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system between 
Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been 
exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish Government has proposed 
efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an increase 
in exports to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures, partial 
privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary policy. In June 
1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the EC's European Currency Unit (ECU) to 
promote stability.  Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in 
the government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% 
in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September 1992. By 
boosting the competitiveness of Finnish exports, these measures presumably 
have kept the economic downturn from being even more severe. Unemployment 
probably will remain a serious problem during the next few years - monthly 
figures in early 1993 are approaching 20% - with the majority of Finnish firms 
facing a weak domestic market and the troubled German and Swedish export 
government's budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993. Helsinki continues to 
harmonize its economic policies with those of the EC during Finland's current 
EC membership bid.
