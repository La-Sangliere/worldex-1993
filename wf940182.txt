ECONOMY 
Overview: Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual 
military establishment. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent 
years has helped the country to cope with these problems. Almost all 
agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan 
embarked on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and 
domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF 
government denationalized several state-owned firms and attracted some foreign 
investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards 
because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate of growth, 
population would double in 25 years.
