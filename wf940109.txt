ECONOMY 
Overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, 
but with an extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and 
comparatively even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on 
the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 
12% of the workforce. In the absence of other natural resources - except 
energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. 
Iceland's economy has been in recession since 1988. The recession deepened in 
1992 due to severe cutbacks in fishing quotas and falling world prices for the 
country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. 
Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and is forecast to contract another 1.5% in 
1993. The center-right government's economic goals include reducing the budget 
and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing 
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the 
economy, and privatizing state-owned industries.  The recession has led to a 
wave of bankruptcies and mergers throughout the economy, as well as the 
highest unemployment of the post-World War II period. The national 
unemployment rate reached 5% in early 1993, with some parts of the country 
experiencing unemployment in the 9-10% range.  Inflation, previously a serious 
problem, declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7% in 1992.
