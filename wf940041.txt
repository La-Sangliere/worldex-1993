ECONOMY 
Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic 
development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic 
industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 
an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to pay for 
imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the climate and 
the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform agenda, 
launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying 
to diversify its agricultural exports and attract foreign investment in 
industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized via public 
auction in September 1991.
