ANTARCTICA 
GEOGRAPHY 
Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle 
 
Map references: Antarctic Region 
 
Area: 
 
total area: 14 million km2 (est.) 
 
land area: 14 million km2 (est.) 
 
comparative area: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US 
 
note: second-smallest continent (after Australia) 
 
Land boundaries: none, but see entry on International disputes 
 
Coastline: 17,968 km 
 
Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International Disputes 
 
International disputes: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic 
Treaty Summary below); sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, 
Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway 
(Queen Maud Land), and UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the 
territorial claims of other nations and have made no claims themselves (the US 
and Russia reserve the right to do so); no formal claims have been made in the 
sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west, where, because of 
floating ice, Antarctica is unapproachable from the sea 
 
Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and 
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica 
because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate 
climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average 
slightly below freezing 
 
meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land, 
Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo 
Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and 
floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent 
 
Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium, copper, 
gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been 
found in small, uncommercial quantities 
 
Land use: 
 
arable land: 0% 
 
permanent crops: 0% 
 
meadows and pastures: 0% 
 
forest and woodland: 0% 
 
other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) 
 
Irrigated land: 0 km2 
 
Environment: mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow 
coastward from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the 
plateau; a circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do 
cyclonic storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation 
reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an 
equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield, 
which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had 
dwindled to the lowest level ever recorded over Antarctica; active volcanism 
on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic 
activity rare and weak 
 
Note: the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent

Antarctic Treaty Summary: The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 
and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework for 
the management of Antarctica.  Administration is carried out through 
consultative member meetings--the 17th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
was in Venice in November 1992. Currently, there are 41 treaty member nations: 
26 consultative and 15 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the 
seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory (some 
claims overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that 
have made no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not 
recognize the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an 
acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date 
indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations 
are--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. 
Nonclaimant consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), 
Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), 
Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), 
South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. 
Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses, 
are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba 
(1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala 
(1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania 
(1971), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992). 
 
Article 1: area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, 
such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment 
may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose 
 
Article 2: freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall 
continue 
 
Article 3: free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with 
the UN and other international agencies 
 
Article 4: does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims 
and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force 
 
Article 5: prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes 
 
Article 6: includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 
degrees 00 minutes south 
 
Article 7: treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial 
observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and 
equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of 
military personnel must be given 
 
 
Article 9: frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations 
 
Article 10: treaty states will discourage activities by any country in 
Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty 
 
Article 11: disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, 
ultimately, by the ICJ 
 
Article 12, 13, 14: deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the 
treaty among involved nations 
 
Other agreements: more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty 
consultative meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures 
for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was 
signed in 1988 but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on 
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits 
ratification; this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic 
environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and 
flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected 
areas; it also prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except 
scientific research; four parties have ratified Protocol as of June 1993 
 
Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US 
nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other 
countries. Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the 
Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and 
criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by 
regulation of statute: The taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction 
of nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or 
scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation 
into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the Antarctic 
Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines and 1 year in 
prison.  The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation, and Interior 
share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic 
Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to 
notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, 
Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other 
nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.  For more information contact 
Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation, 
Washington, DC 20550. 
 
ECONOMY 
Overview: No economic activity at present except for fishing off the coast 
and small-scale tourism, both based abroad. 
 
COMMUNICATIONS 
Ports: none; offshore anchorage only at most coastal stations 
 
Airports: 42 landing facilities at different locations operated by 15 
national governments party to the Treaty; one additional air facility operated 
by commercial (nongovernmental) tourist organization; helicopter pads at 28 of 
these locations; runways at 10 locations are gravel, sea ice, glacier ice, or 
compacted snow surface suitable for wheeled fixed-wing aircraft; no paved 
runways; 16 locations have snow-surface skiways limited to use by ski-equipped 
planes--11 runways/skiways 1,000 to 3,000 m, 3 runways/skiways less than 1,000 
resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; airports do not 
meet ICAO standards; advance approval from governments required for landing 
 
Defense forces 
Note: the Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature, 
such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying 
out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon; it permits 
the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any 
other peaceful purposes
