ECONOMY 
Overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources and a 
diverse industrial base, continues to experience great difficulties in moving 
from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market economy. President 
YEL'TSIN's government made significant strides toward a market economy in 1992 
by freeing most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign exchange 
rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. At the same time, GDP 
fell 19%, according to official statistics, largely reflecting government 
following the freeing of prices in January. The actual decline, however, may 
have been less steep, because industrial and agricultural enterprises had 
strong incentives to understate output to avoid taxes, and official statistics 
may not have fully captured the output of the growing private sector. Despite 
the large drop in output, unemployment at yearend stood at an estimated 3%-4% 
of Russia's 74-million-person labor force; many people, however, are working 
shortened weeks or are on forced leave. Moscow's financial stabilization 
program got off to a good start at the beginning of 1992 but began to falter 
by midyear. Under pressure from industrialists and the Supreme Soviet, the 
government loosened fiscal policies in the second half. In addition, the 
Russian Central Bank relaxed its tight credit policy in July at the behest of 
new Acting Chairman, Viktor GERASHCHENKO. This loosening of financial policies 
led to a sharp increase in prices during the last quarter, and inflation 
reached about 25% per month by yearend. The situation of most consumers 
worsened in 1992. The January price liberalization and a blossoming of private 
vendors filled shelves across the country with previously scarce food items 
and consumer goods, but wages lagged behind inflation, making such goods 
unaffordable for many consumers. Falling real wages forced most Russians to 
spend a larger share of their income on food and to alter their eating habits. 
Indeed, many Russians reduced their consumption of higher priced meat, fish, 
milk, vegetables, and fruit, in favor of more bread and potatoes. As a result 
of higher spending on food, consumers reduced their consumption of nonfood 
goods and services. Despite a slow start and some rough going, the Russian 
government by the end of 1992 scored some successes in its campaign to break 
the state's stranglehold on property and improve the environment for private 
businesses. More peasant farms were created than expected; the number of 
consumers purchasing goods from private traders rose sharply; the portion of 
the population working in the private sector increased to nearly one-fifth; 
and the nine-month-long slump in the privatization of small businesses was 
ended in the fall. Although the output of weapons fell sharply in 1992, most 
defense enterprises continued to encounter numerous difficulties developing 
and marketing consumer products, establishing new supply links, and securing 
resources for retooling. Indeed, total civil production by the defense sector 
fell in 1992 because of shortages of inputs and lower consumer demand caused 
by higher prices. Ruptured ties with former trading partners, output declines, 
and sometimes erratic efforts to move to world prices and decentralize trade - 
foreign and interstate - took a heavy toll on Russia's commercial relations 
with other countries. For the second year in a row, foreign trade was down 
sharply, with exports falling by as much as 25% and imports by 21%. The drop 
in imports would have been much greater if foreign aid - worth an estimated $8 
billion - had not allowed the continued inflow of essential products. Trade 
with the other former Soviet republics continued to decline, and support for 
the ruble as a common currency eroded in the face of Moscow's loose monetary 
policies and rapidly rising prices throughout the region. At the same time, 
Russia paid only a fraction of the $20 billion due on the former USSR's 
roughly $80 billion debt; debt rescheduling remained hung up because of a 
dispute between Russia and Ukraine over division of the former USSR's assets. 
Capital flight also remained a serious problem in 1992. Russia's economic 
difficulties did not abate in the first quarter of 1993. Monthly inflation 
remained at double-digit levels and industrial production continued to slump. 
To reduce the threat of hyperinflation, the government proposed to restrict 
subsidies to enterprises; raise interest rates; set quarterly limits on 
credits, the budget deficit, and 
supply growth; and impose temporary taxes and cut spending if budget targets 
are not met.  But many legislators and Central Bank officials oppose various of 
these austerity measures and failed to approve them in the first part of 1993.
