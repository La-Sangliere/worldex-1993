ECONOMY 
Overview: GDP expanded by roughly 8% in 1992, following growth of 9.3% in 
1991. The economy thus continues to recover from the crisis that preceded the 
ouster of Manuel NORIEGA, even though the government's structural adjustment 
program has been hampered by a lack of popular support and a passive 
administration. Public investment has been limited as the administration has 
kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and economic reform are 
the two major issues the government must face in 1993-94.
