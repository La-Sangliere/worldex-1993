ECONOMY 
Overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces 
the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. 
Most of the population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. 
Domestic output is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. 
Government revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. 
Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term 
prospects for revenues from the devlopment of offshore oil, offshore fishing 
and tourist development. For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely 
dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign trade.
