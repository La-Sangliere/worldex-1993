ECONOMY
Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial
centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy
is essentially capitalistic; over the past thirteen years the ruling Tories
have greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social
welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient
energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business
services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry
continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25% of the work force
and generating 21% of GDP. The economy is emerging out of its 3-year recession
with only weak recovery expected in 1993. Unemployment is hovering around 10%
of the labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a pro-growth strategy,
cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound from the European
exchange rate mechanism.  Excess industrial capacity probably will moderate
inflation which for the first time in a decade is below the EC average. The
major economic policy question for Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which
it participates in the financial and economic integration of Europe.
