Hemisphere.  Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts 
for more than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces 
two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early 
stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and 
generates 20% of exports. The service sectors, including public 
administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor 
force. Basic problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high 
unemployment, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public sector, 
and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which 
are subject to sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program 
initiated by President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take hold.
