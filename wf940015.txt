of the World 
 
Area: 
 
total area: 82.217 million km2 
 
comparative area: slightly less than nine times the size of the US; 
second-largest of the world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger 
than Indian Ocean or Arctic Ocean)

Climate: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa 
near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur 
from May to December, but are most frequent from August to November 
 
Terrain: surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark 
water gyre in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the 
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic 
basin; maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench 
 
Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and 
whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, 
precious stones 
 
Environment: endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea 
lions, turtles, and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, 
southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf 
of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste 
and municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean 
Sea; icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern 
Atlantic from February to August and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda 
and the Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the extreme 
southern Atlantic 
 
Note: ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from 
October to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog 
can be a hazard to shipping from May to September; major choke points include 
the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals; 
strategic straits include the Dover Strait, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, 
The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north Atlantic shipping lanes 
subject to icebergs from February to August; the Equator divides the Atlantic 
Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean
