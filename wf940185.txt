ECONOMY 
Overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but 
exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of 
developing an infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood 
for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and 
gold, accounts for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from 
Australia and development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain 
the economy. Robust growth in 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the 
opening of a large new gold mine helped the advance.
