ECONOMY 
Overview: Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about 
$660. The nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in 
export earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity 
exports.  For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world 
prices has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of 
sales. In 1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold 
this position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, 
which generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work 
force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces and 
has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little success.
