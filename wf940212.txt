ECONOMY 
Overview: Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. Foreign and 
domestic investments have spurred GDP growth at an annual average of more than 
4% in 1986-91. As of 1 January 1993, Spain has wholly liberalized its trade 
and capital markets to EC standards, including integrating agriculture two 
years ahead of schedule. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight 
monetary policy to fight 7% inflation. As a result of this action and the 
worldwide decline in economic growth, Spain's growth rate declined to 1% in 
1992. Spain faces a likely recession in first half 1993. The government 
expects a recovery in the second half, but this depends on stepped-up growth 
in Germany and France. The slowdown in growth - along with displacements 
caused by structural adjustments in preparation for the EC single market - has 
pushed an already high unemployment rate up to 19%.  However, many people 
listed as unemployed work in the underground economy.  If the government can 
stick to its tough economic policies and push further structural reforms, the 
economy will emerge stronger at the end of the 1990s.

reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to 
be developed.
