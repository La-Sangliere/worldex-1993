ECONOMY 
Overview: Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked 
country, highly dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising 
(sheep and goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to 
political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including 
the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). 
Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country, with 
Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. 
Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within 
Afghanistan.  Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is 
lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the 
disruption of trade and transport.
