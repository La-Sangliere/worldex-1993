ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it 
suffered a setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and 
alumina industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an 
economic recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for 
the bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. 
The recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and 
tourism sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage 
on crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the 
economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was largely 
complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989.  In 1991, however, growth 
dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower world bauxite prices, 
and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was 1.5%, supported by a recovery in
