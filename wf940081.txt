ECONOMY 
Overview: One of the world's most developed economies, France has 
substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial 
sector.  Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, 
and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in 
Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products and 
is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector 
generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become 
crucial to the economy. The French economy is entering its fourth consecutive 
year of sluggish growth after a strong expansion in the late 1980s. Growth 
averaged only 1.3% in 1990-92 and is expected to drop to between zero and 
-0.5% in 1993. The government budget deficit rose to 3.2% of GDP in 1992 and 
is expected to be far larger than planned in the 1993 budget. Paris remains 
committed to maintaining the franc-deutsch mark parity, which has kept French 
interest rates high despite France's low inflation. Although the pace of 
economic integration within the European Community has slowed down, 
integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes of the 
various economic sectors.
