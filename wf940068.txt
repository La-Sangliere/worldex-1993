ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components 
average 60% of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid 
growth of free trade zones has established a significant expansion of 
manufacturing for export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, 
tourism has also increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign 
exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the 
economy. The principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, 
cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of 
agricultural products, oil refining, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is 
officially reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment.
