ECONOMY 
Overview: Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2% annual 
level in the 1980s. By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 
billion - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency 
earnings and leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency 
payments. The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an 
aging industrial plant; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological 
developments; investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric 
power from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and motivating 
workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. 
Political bickering in Sofia and the collapse of the DIMITROV government in 
October 1992 have slowed the economic reform process. New Prime Minister 
BEROV, however, has pledged to continue the reforms initiated by the previous 
government. He has promised to continue cooperation with the World Bank and 
IMF, advance negotiations on rescheduling commercial debt, and push ahead with 
privatization. BEROV's government - whose main parliamentary supporters are 
the former Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) - nonetheless appears 
likely to pursue more interventionist tactics in overcoming the country's 
economic problems.
