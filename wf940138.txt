ECONOMY 
Overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, 
especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have fled 
the country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return. 
Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable 
to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, 
while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. 
Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and 
repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring 
countries. The political impasse between the interim government and rebel 
leader Charles Taylor has prevented restoration of normal economic life, 
including the re-establishment of a strong central government with effective 
economic development programs.
