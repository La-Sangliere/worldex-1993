ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, 
and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are 
important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy 
cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk 
products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector 
overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the 
island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light industry 
to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has 
developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw 
material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of 
Jersey's food needs.
