ECONOMY 
Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian 
economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open free market 
economy that can compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that 
dynamic growth would boost real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological 
capabilities of the industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and 
permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: 
inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in 
1988-91, and unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% 
since May 1991. In 1992, growth picked up to 3%, a sign that the new economic 
approach is beginning to pay off.
