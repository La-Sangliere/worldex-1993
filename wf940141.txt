ECONOMY 
Overview: Lithuania is striving to become an independent privatized 
economy. Although it was substantially above average in living standards and 
technology in the old USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and 
Estonia in economic development. The country has no important natural 
resources aside from its arable land and strategic location. Industry depends 
and its rail and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication 
between Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry 
produces a small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex 
machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Because of nuclear power, 
Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its surplus 
to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR, 
however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety 
standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet 
Union. Lithuania held first place in per capita consumption of meat, second 
place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy products. 
Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries.  Lithuania is 
pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least 60% of state-owned property 
(industry, agriculture, and housing), having already sold almost all housing 
and many small enterprises using a voucher system.  Other government priorities 
include encouraging foreign investment by protecting the property rights of 
foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from Eastern markets to the 
more competitive Western markets.  For the moment, Lithuania will remain highly 
dependent on Russia for energy, raw materials, grains, and markets for its 
products. In 1992, output plummeted by 30% because of cumulative problems with 
inputs and with markets, problems that were accentuated by the phasing out of 
the Russian ruble as the medium of exchange.
