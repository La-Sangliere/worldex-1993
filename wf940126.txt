ECONOMY 
Overview: The second-largest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, 
Kazakhstan has vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is 
highly dependent on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for 
finished consumer and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with 
serious pollution problems, backward technology, and little experience in 
foreign markets. The government in 1992 continued to push privatization of the 
economy and freed many prices. Output in 1992 dropped because of problems 
common to the ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, especially the cumulative 
effects of the disruption of old supply channels and the slow process of 
creating new economic institutions. Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, 
and managerial skills for a quick recovery of output. US firms have been 
enlisted to increase oil output but face formidable obstacles; for example, 
oil can now reach Western markets only through pipelines that run across 
independent former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic Communist 
control has brought ethnic grievances into the open.  The 6 million Russians in 
the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility of a society 
dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the formidable 
obstacles to the prioritization of national objectives and the creation of a 
productive, technologically advancing society.
