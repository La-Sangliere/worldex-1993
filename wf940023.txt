ECONOMY 
Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and 
related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified into 
manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer of the 
labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy slowed in 
1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency reserves and 
inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an austere economic 
reform program.
