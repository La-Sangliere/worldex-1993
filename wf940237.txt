ECONOMY 
Overview: Uruguay is a small economy with favorable climate, good soils, 
and solid hydropower potential. Economic development has been held back by 
excessive government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130% inflation. 
After several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by about 8% in 1992. 
The rise is attributable mainly to an increase in Argentine demand for 
Uruguayan exports, particularly agricultural products and electricity. In a 
major step toward greater regional economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had 
joined Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common 
Market (Mercosur). A referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of 
landmark privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President 
LACALLE's broad economic reform plan.
