ECONOMY 
Overview: Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide 
expanses of unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic 
activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of 
livestock - Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the 
tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production.  Timber 
and fishing are also important sectors. In 1992 the Mongolian leadership 
continued its struggle with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable 
to the crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and development 
partner. Moscow cut almost all aid in 1991, and little was provided in 1992. 
Industry in 1992 was hit hard by energy shortages, mainly due to disruptions 
in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.  By the end of the 
year, the country was perilously close to a complete shutdown of its 
centralized energy supply system, due to critical coal shortages. The 
government is moving away from the Soviet-style, centrally planned economy 
through privatization and price reform.
