ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 
1970s, is now dominated by the oil sector. In 1981-85, oil accounted for about 
45% of GDP, 80% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on average. 
The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial increase 
in per capita national income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced 
migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to 
among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The subsequent slide of Gabon's 
economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989-90, 
but debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further 
domestic development. Real growth in 1991-92 was weak because of a combination 
of an overstaffed bureaucracy, a large budget deficit, and the continued 
underdevelopment of the whole economy outside the petroleum sector.
